## Jukebit
#### Collaborate on playlists with people around the world

## General Info
### App Summary 
Jukebit is a forum that encourages users to explore and share music. Users can create any playlist theme they can think of, and anyone can add songs they think fit the theme. Explore playlist themes to find one that suits your interests, no matter how niche they might be. 


### Features 
Jukebit uses Google OAUTH to enable users to login and access the full slate of features. Once logged in, users are about to create playlists, add songs, and view playlist owner information. Only the playlist owner is able to delete the playlists and songs attached to their ID, as well as and edit it's name and description.

## Next Steps 

There are so many ways I'd like to expand and improve Jukebit. Here are my current ice box items:

<ul>
<li>Add up/down vote functionality to refine playlists.</li>
<li>Let users favorite a playlist to save it to their profile.</li>
<li>Update CSS for a sleeker, less busy aesthetic.</li>
<li>Implement a Spotify API that makes it easy for users to search and add songs, as well as listen in the app itself.</li>
<li>Add a music visualizer option that matches the visual aesthetic and syncs to music.</li>
<li>Add a comment section so users can interact with each other on a more personal level.</li>
</ul>
